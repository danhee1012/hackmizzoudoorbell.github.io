The Story
=========

The motivation is simple - the doorbell in its current form is just bad. period.


NOTE: Currently the printable version does not work with IE. We don't know why. We're working on it. Or maybe not. Ha!

The print version should open in a new tab. The qrcode will look out of place now. Just hit Ctrl+P and the qrcode should snap back into position in the print preview.
